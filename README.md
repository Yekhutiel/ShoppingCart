# ShoppingCart
Shopping list app

* this app uses AsyncStorage to save shopping list for offline use

* steps: 
	1. create main display:
		- will hold other components and such necessary details
		- is where user will interact

	2. add variables and asyncstorage functions
	
	3. create ItemList component:
		- will render each element of the cart in a list format


* ToDo:
	- convert styles' measurements to percentage
	- compare mobile view to webview
	- ~ give each item an ID (incorporate it when sending them as object to ItemList) ~
	- ~ add 'clear()' function ~ clear list after everything is complete
		- items that are touched should cross the words to show completion
		- items that were bellow now show up above uncrossed items, when crossed
		- when crossed item is pressed, it uncrossed
		-  when all items crossed, show a message then clear items
	- make better logo
	-
